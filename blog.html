            <p>"Learn to build a real-world application—a mortgage calculator—while mastering core software engineering principles. You’ll design modular Python code, use inheritance to expand functionality, and ensure quality through best practices like the DRY principle, PEP 8 compliance, and automated testing with pytest. By the end, you’ll have the skills to create efficient, maintainable, and scalable software solutions for real-world challenges."</p>

          From OpenAI:<br><br>
          <blockquote cite="http://">
            <p>"We’ve observed agents discovering progressively more complex tool use while playing a simple game of hide-and-seek. Through training in our new simulated hide-and-seek environment, agents build a series of six distinct strategies and counterstrategies, some of which we did not know our environment supported. The self-supervised emergent complexity in this simple environment further suggests that multi-agent co-adaptation may one day produce extremely complex and intelligent behavior.""</p>

          <blockquote cite="http://">
            <p>"I recently started a job in which I, trained as a mathematician, am working with a number of colleagues who were trained as physicists. At lunch, this situation led to a discussion of the connections between the two fields, which in turn led to a discussion of Eugene Wigner’s article “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences.” I reluctantly admitted that although I had heard and read about the article, and thought I understood its general gist, I had never taken the time to read and digest the article for myself. To remedy this sad state of affairs I decided to carefully read it and provide a summary to increase my understanding of the article. I hope that you, the reader, find it helpful as well."</p>

        A provocative question from the MIT Technology Review:<br><br>
        <blockquote cite="http://">
          <p>"Can machine-learning algorithms identify interesting or elegant patterns in mathematics? Could they even be arbiters of mathematical beauty?"</p>
          <p>"Today we get an answer of sorts thanks to the work of Chai Wah Wu at IBM’s TJ Watson Research Center in New York state. Wu has built a machine-learning algorithm that has learned to identify certain types of elegance in mathematical structures and used it to filter interesting sequences from entirely random ones."</p>
