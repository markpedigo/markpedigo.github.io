  <h3>Sept 15, 2019</h3>
  <p>Starting up a new blog made me think, of course, of the <a href="https://markpedigo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">personal blog</a> I kept while in grad school. I read through some entries and now I'm all nostalgic and weepy. For a soundtrack while I perused through it, I found a live footage of the 35th anniversary concert of Toto. I always feel slightly guilty listening to Toto, like it's halfway between smaltzy and transgressive. Not sure what all that's about. Seemed appropriate, somehow.</p>

  <p>Speaking of trips down memory lane... Thursday I took a personal day for a combination of sinus and just plain ol' worn out. I've been burning the candle from both ends lately, and dammit, I just need a day. Anyway, I bought the complete collection of <em>Bloom County</em> comix from Humble Bundle and partially read through it. <em>Stranger Things</em> was reliving the 80s the way you remembered it (at least the first couple seasons, what the hell happened this year?); Bloom County was in some sense the way it was, day by day. (Yes, filtered through smart ass satire, but you know what I mean.) It made me wonder how much of my outlook<sup>*</sup>emanated from here. I had to pick it up somewhere, and my friends, while smart asses in their own right, didn’t quite have that peculiar spin on things. Anyway, apparently BC started back up a few years ago, apparently inspired by Trump madness. I think one of the books I picked up in the collection is the new stuff. Curious to see where it went and where it’s going.</p>

  <p>Saturday (yesterday), Mandy and I met up with a dear friend who’s been going through some personal shit. It was good to see her and I think all of us managed to cheer each other up a bit. I think she particularly enjoyed Mandy and my description of our Labor Day festivities. We went on a road trip to Lynn, Missouri, about two hours away from our home in South St. Louis County to an Antique Mall / Flea Market called “Old School” (because it is quite literally an old school – an elementary school, to be exact). We brought a scavenger hunt list and found several items on it. Creepy Jesus? Check. Horribly inappropriate non-PC thing no one in their right mind would create today? Does “Your Favorite Minstrel Hits,” complete with cover showing someone in black face count? Why, yes, that little nasty fits the bill. Hardy Boy’s book, because every antique mall in mid-America has a few dozen of them lying around? No! Not a single one in sight. Sorry, Charlie. I guess this is the only antique mall without. For the curious/weird item, how about this giant glass case filled with bongs, lighters and other paraphernalia? Yep, that's another check.</p>

  <p>Speaking of weird shit in antique malls, the last time we played this game we found about <a href="https://www.worldpianonews.com/event/auction/what-is-a-piano-baby/">"Piano Babies."</a> Apparently, at the turn of the century, a display of middle-class wealth was a piano. To keep the piano dust free, it was covered up in its off time with a sheet, which was held in place with a kind of paper weight. A paper weight in the form of a carefully detailed porcelain doll with the body of a adult and the face of a baby! Not just any baby, though. One that somehow has retained memories of the depravities of past lives, and finds it all a bit too amusing for comfortable conversation. Apparently, these are collectibles now. I find them deliciously creepy. (Hint, hint: Christmas is coming up fairly soon.)</p>

  <p>For the first half of the day (slightly more), I watched lectures 3 and 4 of the latest neural net fast.ai track in preparation for the Meetup tomorrow night. Lecture 3 finished up the "make applications before you really know what you're doing" part of the series; part 4 started the more math-heavy portion of the evening, using NLP as its vehicle. I enjoyed Lecture 4 quite a bit. After that, I picked up <em>Is God A Mathematician?</em> on Audible, which I plan to write about in the technical part of this blog. Stay tuned!</p>

  <sup>*</sup>If you’re familiar with the comic, that pun was hysterical. Yes, it was, admit it. If you haven't, skip it, it doesn't matter. You had to be there.
