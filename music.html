  <p>Bands</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.westwindswing.com/" target="_blank">Westwind Swing Band</a> (Twin Cities). Big Band specializing in the music of the 1902s, 30s and 40s.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.northstarjazzworkshops.com/welcome" target="_blank">North Star Jazz Workshops</a> (Twin Cities). I participate as a student in these small combo jazz workshops.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.epcommunityband.com/jazz-on-the-prairie" target="_blank">Jazz on the Prairie</a> (Twin Cities). Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL1W_4ih1VY&t=12s" target="_blank">video</a> of a gig we played at the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum. There are two pianists in this video. I'm the one not wearing a hat.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@markpedigotrio7535/videos?app=desktop" target="_blank">Mark Pedigo Trio</a> (St. Louis). I briefly (about a year) led a piano trio that played corporate events and restaraunts. We stopped playing out when the bass player went out East to get his Masters. He's since got his PhD and is a prof at ASU. Go Nick!</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.soundclick.com/dixierhythmkings" target="_blank">Dixie Rhythm Kings</a> (St. Louis). I played in this band for about 10 years. It's a traditional jazz band (i.e., NOLA-style) that plays for assisted living facilities.</li>
    <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/big-band-st-louis" target="_blank">St. Louis Big Band</a> (St. Louis). I believe there's another band of this name now. This one played lots and lots of weddings and assorted other gigs. I quit the band shortly before someone thought it was a good idea to bring in circus folks to perform during the shows (yes, really). I saw a pic somewhere of a trapeze artist swinging above the sax section. The players had a hard time keeping their eyes on the music.</li>
    <li>Many college and high school jazz bands, including combos at the University of Missouri St. Louis when Jim Widner led the jazz offerings.</li>
  </ul>
