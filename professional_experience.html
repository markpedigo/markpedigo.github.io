<h1>Resume</h1>
<br><br><br><br>
<p>TL;DR. After I graduated with my PhD in mathematics from Saint Louis University, I worked for a stint with Booz Allen Hamilton. There, I heard about this thing called "data science" which mixed mathematics and programming in an interesting way. I've been working as a Data Scientist since. Along the way, I moonlighted as an Adjunct Professor at Wash U for about ten years, and wrote a few things, too.</p>
