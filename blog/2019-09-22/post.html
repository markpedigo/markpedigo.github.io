    <h1>Data Camp Project - TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game</h1>

    <div style="margin:20mm">
      <p>I am a big fan of the MOOC. You can take classes on your own time, rewind the parts you didn't understand (or spaced out during), and get practice at learning new skills. Not everyone is a fan, I realize, but I believe that if you take the classes for what they are – an introduction to a topic, just a way to whet your appetite, certainly not a deep dive – they can be quite useful. The DataScience tracks keep you broadly engaged with a particular set of skills and get you coding. (For real understanding, you'll need to dig deeper. Again, an appetizer, not a meal). For more depth, you are welcome to explore on your own.</p>
      <p>This is the first (other than the introductory “what is a project”) project that I’ve completed on DataCamp. My goals for this one:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Learn about DataCamp projects.</li>
      <li>Finish a requirement for the new Data Science track.</li>
      <li>Learn how to incorporate Jupyter notebooks into a web page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <h3>Description</h3>
      From the <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/projects/684">website</a>.
      <blockquote cite="https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/684">
        "Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. And in this project, you will find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. You will answer questions like:
        <ul>
          <li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>
          <li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>
          <li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>
          <li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>
        </ul>
        This project gives you an opportunity to apply the skills from Intermediate Python for Data Science.
        The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018."
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Data</h3>
      The project consists of analyzing the following three data sets, each of which contains a different type of data for every Super Bowl through 2018.
      <ul>
        <li>Game data</li>
        <li>TV data</li>
        <li>Halftime musician data</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Exercises in the worksheet</li>
        <li>pandas query statement versus masks</li>
        <li>From inspecting the project as saved to a website, I get an idea of how they automate the grading of worksheets. DataCamp’s autograding mechanism could be useful information for grading my own classes, and I expect serve as good examples of best practices in unit testing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I am not a sports fan, which in St. Louis takes a fair bit of effort. Sure, I'll watch a game with friends and enjoy the crowd and the comraderie, but keeping up game by game with the stats and latest happenings? That's just too much like work. I'd rather do other things, for instance, write a blog. So I was not aware that the "left shark" was a thing. Ha! Good for him.</li>
